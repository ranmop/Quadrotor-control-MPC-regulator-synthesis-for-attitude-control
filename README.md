# Quadrotor control: MPC regulator synthesis for attitude control
The rise of autonomous drones is one of the most remarkable shifts that we can anticipate in the coming decades. While their current applications are already extensive, the potential uses of quadcopters are poised to expand significantly over time. Drones will be used in a wide range of domains, including delivery services, entertainment, medicine, military operations, search and rescue missions, structural integrity assessments, and many others.

In many cases, autonomous drones will be able to navigate predetermined paths within a three-dimensional space without any human intervention. In some cases, the only human input required will be to specify the drone's destination. A computer will then generate a specific trajectory in that direction, and the drone's control algorithms will precisely calculate the optimal rotor speeds required to faithfully trace that trajectory with an exceptional level of accuracy.

Here are some specific examples of how autonomous drones will be used in the future:

    Delivery services: Autonomous drones will be used to deliver packages to customers' homes and businesses. This will reduce traffic congestion and pollution, and it will also make deliveries more efficient and reliable.
    Entertainment: Autonomous drones will be used to provide aerial entertainment, such as light shows and fireworks displays. They can also be used to film movies and TV shows, and to provide aerial photography and videography services.
    Medicine: Autonomous drones will be used to deliver medical supplies to remote areas, and to transport patients to hospitals. They can also be used to perform medical procedures, such as delivering vaccines or administering medication.
    Military operations: Autonomous drones will be used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat. They can also be used to deliver weapons and supplies to troops on the ground.
    Search and rescue missions: Autonomous drones will be used to search for missing persons and to rescue people from natural disasters. They can also be used to assess damage and to provide logistical support.
    Structural integrity assessments: Autonomous drones will be used to inspect bridges, buildings, and other structures for damage. This can help to prevent accidents and to ensure the safety of people and property.

These are just a few examples of the many ways that autonomous drones will be used in the future. As technology continues to advance, the potential uses of these drones will become even more widespread and varied.
