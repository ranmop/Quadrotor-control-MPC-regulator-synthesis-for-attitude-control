# Quadrotor control: MPC-regulator-synthesis-for-attitude-control

Anticipate one of the most remarkable shifts in the coming decades: the rise of autonomous drones. While their utilization is already extensive, the potential applications of quadcopters are poised to expand significantly over time. Drones will find utility in realms such as delivery services, entertainment, medicine, military operations, search and rescue missions, structural integrity assessments – situations where accessibility is a challenge for humans – and across numerous other domains.

Frequently, scenarios will emerge where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) must navigate a predetermined path within a three-dimensional space without human intervention. In fact, human input might be as straightforward as issuing a basic directive for the drone's destination. Subsequently, a computer will generate a specific trajectory in that direction, and the UAV's control algorithms will precisely calculate the optimal rotor speeds required to faithfully trace that trajectory with an exceptional level of accuracy.
