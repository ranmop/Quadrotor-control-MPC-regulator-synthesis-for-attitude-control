# Quadrotor control: MPC regulator synthesis for attitude control
The rise of autonomous drones is one of the most remarkable shifts that we can anticipate in the coming decades. While their current applications are already extensive, the potential uses of quadcopters are poised to expand significantly over time. Drones will be used in a wide range of domains, including delivery services, entertainment, medicine, military operations, search and rescue missions, structural integrity assessments, and many others.

In many cases, autonomous drones will be able to navigate predetermined paths within a three-dimensional space without any human intervention. In some cases, the only human input required will be to specify the drone's destination. A computer will then generate a specific trajectory in that direction, and the drone's control algorithms will precisely calculate the optimal rotor speeds required to faithfully trace that trajectory with an exceptional level of accuracy.
